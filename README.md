1st week of learning Javascript - having fun making a little game about boiling eggs!
- boil the egg for less than 5 seconds and you get a runny egg > start agin
- boil the egg for 10 seconds and you've overcooked it :( > start again
- boil the egg in between 5 and 10 seconds > you have a delicious egg to eat
